Data Analysis and Visualization: Hotel Bookings
In this Python-based data analysis and visualization project, I harnessed the capabilities of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to delve into a Hotel Bookings dataset. By employing Pandas for data preprocessing and manipulation, along with NumPy for performing numerical computations, I sought to reveal meaningful insights within the realm of hotel bookings. Matplotlib played a crucial role in crafting compelling visualizations that brought to light booking trends, guest demographics, and other pertinent insights.

Objective:
The core objective of this data analysis and visualization project is to leverage the power of Python programming in conjunction with the NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries to derive valuable insights from a Hotel Bookings dataset. Through strategic data preprocessing, manipulation, advanced numerical computations, and the creation of impactful visualizations, the project aims to unearth actionable patterns and trends related to booking behaviors, guest preferences, and occupancy dynamics within the domain of hotel management.
