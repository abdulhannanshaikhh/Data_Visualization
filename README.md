Data Analysis and Visualization: Hotel Bookings
In this Python-based data analysis and visualization project, I harnessed the capabilities of NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to delve into a Hotel Bookings dataset. By employing Pandas for data preprocessing and manipulation, along with NumPy for performing numerical computations, I sought to reveal meaningful insights within the realm of hotel bookings. Matplotlib played a crucial role in crafting compelling visualizations that brought to light booking trends, guest demographics, and other pertinent insights.
